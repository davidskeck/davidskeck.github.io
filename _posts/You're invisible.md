When you're in the moment, when you're out with friends, when you're in your element, you're invisible. At least, to yourself. You're not thinking about what you look like. You're not concerned with what your hair is doing, how your clothes fit, or anything external. Your mind is on social interaction. You're thinking about the experience. That's how it is for everyone, at least, from what I can tell.

That's one reason it can be so painful if someone says something disparaging about your appearance. If it's something you can quickly fix (food on your teeth, shirt unbuttoned, etc), then it's fine, even kind. But otherwise it only rips you from a moment when you're immersed in life. What a terrible thing to do to someone. Mentioning that someone's appearance doesn't meet some imagined social contract only lessens our experience.

By telling someone they're overweight, or that their clothes aren't stylish, or even refusing to acknowledge someone who is a little different, we force them to confront the idea that some part of society thinks they're not good enough. For what purpose? To reassert that we are the ones who belong in society? That we're somehow superior? No, it's worthless.

Showing people that they're important, that we see them, or that we're a witness to their lives in a world that can seem isolating, is one of the most important purposes of life. We're all in this together, collectively experiencing a unique form consciousness in a universe we don't understand. The least important thing is how we look like doing it.
