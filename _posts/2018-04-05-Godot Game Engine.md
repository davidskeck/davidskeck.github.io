If you are at all interested in learning game development I highly recommend trying out [Godot](https://godotengine.org). It is beautifully designed and an absolute joy to work with. I found myself saying out loud about how much I appreciated the thoughtfulness put into the design as I was using it. They definitely took to heart a great [quote by Steve Jobs](http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/38348.html).

I recommend starting with the [Your First Game](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.0/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html) tutorial.
