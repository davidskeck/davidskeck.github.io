*The top of [Humpback Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humpback_Rock).*

My sister and I had quite a time getting to the top of Humpback Rock. There were fallen trees blocking our path, streams that had frozen over into huge path-blocking obstacles, and easy-to-miss trail markers, but we made it.
