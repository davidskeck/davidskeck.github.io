Take a moment to relax. Brew some coffee, sit back, and take a look around.

Are the choices you've made taking you closer to your goals?

Never forget that your current job, relationship, and other lifestyle choices are malleable.

Resist the urge to "keep your head down" and become another person who makes their life a series of "let's get this over with"s.

You don't want to work that way, and you would contribute a lot more to your field if you didn't.

This is your life -- the only time you will ever have.

Don't forget that you can change it.
