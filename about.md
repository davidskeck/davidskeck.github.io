Hi! I'm David Keck. This is Easily Fascinated. It's my personal website about endless curiosity, optimism, and fascination for life. It's one of my ways of following [Mary Oliver](http://maryoliver.beacon.org)'s wonderful instructions for living a life.

>>> Instructions for living a life. 
>>> Pay attention. 
>>> Be astonished. 
>>> Tell about it.

I started this website because I want a place to share things I care about and I want to do it on my terms.

This is what the web was [designed](https://kottke.org/18/04/the-missing-building-blocks-of-the-web) to do -- allow you to upload what you want to your own little corner of it. I'm very happy to have place to do that.

It took me a while to figure out why I would even want to have my own website when there are so many ways to share things online. Reading about how the web is supposed to work helped me understand. The web is made for sharing. Creating is part of being a citzen of the Internet. Putting your data into walled gardens where it's sold to the highest bidder isn't my vision for the Internet.

I hope it isn't yours either.

I made this website using a framework called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). It's very easy to get started. It gives me hope that there could be a future where making your own website becomes the norm and cookie-cutter, data-harvesting social media goes the way of the Dodo.

I hope you enjoy your time on my site! If you have anything to add, feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:hello@davidskeck.com) anytime.
