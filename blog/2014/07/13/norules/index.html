  <article class="post-content">
  <p>Recently, and, likely because I just graduated, I’ve been hearing dubious
business advice like crazy. Stuff like “Don’t show your weaknesses”, and
“Pretend to know everything.”</p>

<p>I’m sure it’s all well meaning, but, to me, it’s all garbage. It might be
fine if you want to get a job under false pretenses or plan on getting a position
that isn’t right for you or your employer.</p>

<p>If I don’t know a certain technology and I get asked about it in an interview, I always
say directly that I don’t know anything about that, but I would be willing to
learn. And, that’s only if I’m actually interested in learning it.</p>

<p>I want to expose my ignorance. Then I get to learn. If I come into a job
acting like I know all about everything, I don’t get that chance.</p>

<p>You might be thinking, this guy has no idea about the “real-world” job market.
And, you would be right! I think my naiveté and optimism will to serve me well.
I don’t have to lie or feel pressured to perform in something I’ve never even
given myself a chance to learn. I’m not disenchanted, and I can bring passion
along with programming skills.</p>

<p>And, you know, I might not get the job that I thought I wanted. But that’s fine
too. I have the luxury right now of being able to say no and accepting when
companies do the same. I don’t have a family to support or any expenses
that a minimum wage job couldn’t float for at least a few years.</p>

<p>I just know I would be much happier working at a Starbucks than under the
thumb of some corporation that strangles my spirit.</p>

<p>You have to protect your spark of optimism and hope with everything you have. Too
many people give up too soon or think that these are just the rules of the business world.</p>

<p>There are no rules. Do what makes sense to you.</p>
