  <article class="post-content">
  <p>Recently, and, likely because I just graduated, I’ve been hearing dubious
business advice like crazy. Stuff like “Don’t show your weaknesses”, and
“Pretend to know everything.”</p>

<p>I’m sure it’s all well meaning, but, to me, it’s all garbage. It might be
fine if you want to get a job under false pretenses or plan on getting a position
that isn’t right for you or your employer.</p>

<p>If I don’t know a certain technology and I get asked about it in an interview, I always
say directly that I don’t know anything about that, but I would be willing to
learn. And, that’s only if I’m actually interested in learning it.</p>

<p>I want to expose my ignorance. Then I get to learn. If I come into a job
acting like I know all about everything, I don’t get that chance.</p>

<p>You might be thinking, this guy has no idea about the “real-world” job market.
And, you would be right! I think my naiveté and optimism will to serve me well.
I don’t have to lie or feel pressured to perform in something I’ve never even
given myself a chance to learn. I’m not disenchanted, and I can bring passion
along with programming skills.</p>

<p>And, you know, I might not get the job that I thought I wanted. But that’s fine
too. I have the luxury right now of being able to say no and accepting when
companies do the same. I don’t have a family to support or any expenses
that a minimum wage job couldn’t float for at least a few years.</p>

<p>I just know I would be much happier working at a Starbucks than under the
thumb of some corporation that strangles my spirit.</p>

<p>I know that I have to protect my spark of optimism and hope with everything I have. Too
many people give up too soon or think that these are just the rules of the business world.</p>

<p>There are no rules. Do what makes sense to you.</p>
