  <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11878168-anything-you-want"><img src="http://davidskeck.github.io/assets/DerekSivers-AnythingYouWant-300x378.jpg" alt="Anything You Want Cover" title="Anything You Want - Derek Sivers" /></a></p>

<p>I had the chance to read this book about a week ago. I expected to just
read the first few pages before heading into work, but I found it so enthralling that
I read the whole thing that morning. It only took about an hour, just like
Derek said it would in the first chapter.</p>

<p>As you can tell, this book is pretty short. The content feels almost obsessively
pared down to the most relevant message possible.</p>

<p>I love this book is because its voice is so lucid. Everything was so clear and
easy to follow.</p>

<p>The chapters of the book are just dripping with understanding. Each scenario
offers a chance to see a new perspective and step back from what might be
considered “common sense” to illuminate an important insight that was made.</p>

<p>At the end of the book, Sivers invites anyone who has “made it this far” to email him
with any comments or questions. I took advantage of this offer and I received an email
back the very next day. It is obvious he cares about his readers, and it was
nice to know that Sivers embodies the qualities he discusses in this book.</p>

<p>I feel like I learned a lot, and I definitely laughed a lot, but the most
important thing I experienced from reading this book was an overwhelming
sense of optimism and empowerment.</p>
