        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;business-lessons-from-someone-with-no-experience-in-business&quot;&gt;Business lessons from someone with no experience in business&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, and, likely because I just graduated, I’ve been hearing dubious
business advice like crazy. Stuff like “Don’t show your weaknesses”, and
“Pretend to know everything.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure it’s all well meaning, but, to me, it’s all garbage. It might be
fine if you want to get a job under false pretenses or plan on getting a position
that isn’t right for you or your employer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I don’t know a certain technology and I get asked about it in an interview, I always
say directly that I don’t know anything about that, but I would be willing to
learn. And, that’s only if I’m actually interested in learning it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to expose my ignorance. Then I get to learn. If I come into a job
acting like I know all about everything, I don’t get that chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking, this guy has no idea about the “real-world” job market.
And, you would be right! I think my naiveté and optimism will to serve me well.
I don’t have to lie or feel pressured to perform in something I’ve never even
given myself a chance to learn. I’m not disenchanted, and I can bring passion
along with programming skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, you know, I might not get the job that I thought I wanted. But that’s fine
too. I have the luxury right now of being able to say no and accepting when
companies do the same. I don’t have a family to support or any expenses
that a minimum wage job couldn’t float for at least a few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just know I would be much happier working at a Starbucks than under the
thumb of some corporation that strangles my spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to protect your spark of optimism and hope with everything you have. Too
many people give up too soon or think that these are just the rules of the business world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no rules. Do what makes sense to you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>&quot;Anything You Want&quot; - Book review</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11878168-anything-you-want&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://davidskeck.github.io/assets/DerekSivers-AnythingYouWant-300x378.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Anything You Want Cover&quot; title=&quot;Anything You Want - Derek Sivers&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the chance to read this book about a week ago. I expected to just
read the first few pages before heading into work, but I found it so enthralling that
I read the whole thing that morning. It only took about an hour, just like
Derek said it would in the first chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can tell, this book is pretty short. The content feels almost obsessively
pared down to the most relevant message possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love this book is because its voice is so lucid. Everything was so clear and
easy to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapters of the book are just dripping with understanding. Each scenario
offers a chance to see a new perspective and step back from what might be
considered “common sense” to illuminate an important insight that was made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the book, Sivers invites anyone who has “made it this far” to email him
with any comments or questions. I took advantage of this offer and I received an email
back the very next day. It is obvious he cares about his readers, and it was
nice to know that Sivers embodies the qualities he discusses in this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I learned a lot, and I definitely laughed a lot, but the most
important thing I experienced from reading this book was an overwhelming
sense of optimism and empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hello.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://davidskeck.github.io/assets/asR3bZz.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;David Keck&quot; title=&quot;David Keck&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-are-you&quot;&gt;Who are you?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m David Keck. I just graduated this May with a Bachelor of Computer Science. I love computers, and I started programming when I was about twelve or thirteen in BASIC. Currently, I’m working at NASA as an intern, making flight software for an in-development satellite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-this-site&quot;&gt;What is this site?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my personal website where I’ll be posting information about my projects, thoughts, and ideas. I’ll also be linking to anything I find interesting with “Link Love” posts every now and then. (Thanks for the idea, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marksdailyapple.com&quot;&gt;Mark Sisson&lt;/a&gt;.) You can also view website source on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/davidskeck/davidskeck.github.io&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-can-i-contact-you&quot;&gt;How can I contact you?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed, this website is lacking a comment section. This was partially intentional, and also partially because I am just learning the art of web design. If you have any comments or questions about anything you see on this website, feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#100;&amp;#097;&amp;#118;&amp;#105;&amp;#100;&amp;#064;&amp;#107;&amp;#101;&amp;#099;&amp;#107;&amp;#046;&amp;#110;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;&quot;&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt;.  Use the title of the post as the email
subject so I can better respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-your-favorite-color&quot;&gt;What’s your favorite color?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Single favorite? Dark blue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Favorite combination? Dark green and dark grey.&lt;/p&gt;
