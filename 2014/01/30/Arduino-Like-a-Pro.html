<p>When I started this project, I knew almost nothing about Arduino. Today, I’m going to detail what I’ve learned about the Arduino platform over the past month.</p>

<p>Arduino is amazingly easy to get started in. If you know any C or C++, it just gets easier. I got an Uno board, then had a look over the example code and realized just how powerful the platform is. I can interface nearly any type of sensor and immediately start prototyping ideas.</p>

<p>As easy as it is to get started with simple programs (known as sketches to the Arduino community), there is a bit of a learning curve for those lacking electronics experience. For example, I didn’t know how to select the right value resistor for the LED circuits I made in the beginning. Thanks to some helpful online <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/219">tutorials</a> I was able to understand Ohm’s law and why LEDs need resistors. Another thing that was unclear to me at first was how sensors worked with micro controllers. Learning this was a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Basically, you can have two types of sensors plugged into an Arduino input: <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/digitalRead">digital</a> or <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/AnalogInput">analog</a>. If you’re doing a digital input, you’ve got two choices, 0 (LOW) or 1 (HIGH). If you’re doing analog, the microcontroller will report from 0 to 1023, depending on how much voltage is being detected.</p>

<p>That’s input. There is also output. Digital output works the way you’d expect, with 0 (LOW) and 1 (HIGH), but the analog output pins on the Arduino can use <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/PWM">pulse width modulation (PWM)</a> to output from 0-255. So, you can use an analog input signal divided by 4 to map it evenly to an analog output. Fun stuff!</p>

<p>One of the best resources I’ve found for learning the details of the Arduino IDE and for basic programming in C++ is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Arduino-Getting-Started-Sketches/dp/0071784225">Simon Monk’s book</a> “Getting Started with Sketches”. All the basics are covered. It’s a very quick read at only 150 easy pages.</p>

<p>So, now that I’ve got a pretty good hold on Arduino and how it works, the possibilities truly seem infinite. Paring the ideas down into the essentials of what I want to accomplish in this project is one of the most important parts of this process. Planning carefully will save a lot of time later on. I won’t have to rewrite large blocks of code that I deem outside the scope of the project, because I will have all of the important stuff planned. Although, having such a huge amount of potential from a tiny microprocessor is a wonderful feeling.</p>

<p>Here’s what I’m currently planning to use for this project:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.pololu.com/product/2191">Arduino Uno R3</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.pololu.com/product/2506">Pololu Zumo Shield with Robot and Reflectance Array</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.pololu.com/product/1132">Three Sharp Digital Distance Sensors 5cm</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adafruit Bluefruit EZ Link Shield with Stacking Headers</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>A note on Adafruit’s Bluefruit Shield: I received mine not too long ago, and I experienced a lot of issues using it on a Macbook. Adafruit has <a href="http://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&amp;t=47431">acknowledged</a> this issue, and released a software patch, but it didn’t fix everything for me. They’re currently working on making an entirely new board that fixes the issue without a software patch. Adafruit’s customer service was amazing on this issue. They refunded the purchase price and let me keep the board just in case I decide I have a use for it.</p>

<p>Thanks for following my progress on this project!</p>
