[Celeste](http://www.celestegame.com) is a game that surprises you with empathy. 

One second you're just barely making it across some chasm, heart racing... the next your heart is opened and warmed by a storyline that's so relatable and so human that you might never see it coming.

The story ties together so well with the high difficulty level that it becomes a personal challenge to finish it. It turns into something that you want to prove to yourself that you're capable of.
